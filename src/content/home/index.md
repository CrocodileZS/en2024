## Hi, my name is Yuyang Zhou (Joey) 周宇洋.

In Chinese, the three characters mean **inclusion, the universe and the ocean**.

I completed my **Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)** in July 2025. Starting 1 September 2025, I’ll join **ING** as a Tech Class Engineer.

Before that, I received my **Bachelor’s degree** from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**. My internships exposed me to diverse industries from national infrastructure to consumer tech and global manufacturing, which shaped my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

Technically, my focus is on **backend engineering** and **applied AI**. I have hands-on experience with Python, Java (Spring Boot) and RESTful API design, as well as working knowledge of MySQL, Docker, and cloud platforms (AWS). My Master’s project explored efficient deployment of large video-language models on edge devices, giving me exposure to model quantization and distributed inference.

Outside of work, I enjoy **photography**, playing **Hearthstone**, and creating **ASMR content**.
