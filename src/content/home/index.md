## Hi, my name is Yuyang Zhou (Joey) 周宇洋.

In Chinese, the three characters mean **inclusion, the universe and the ocean**.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)** in the Netherlands in July 2025. Starting 1 September 2025, I’ll join **ING** as a Tech Class Engineer.

Before that, I received my **Bachelor’s degree** from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**. My internships exposed me to diverse industries from national infrastructure to consumer tech and global manufacturing, which shaped my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

Outside of work, I enjoy **photography** (Phone & Canon EOS M50), playing **Hearthstone** (Druid player), and creating **ASMR content** (Especially rapid tapping and eating sounds).

Fun fact about me:
* I once fell off the 2nd floor as a teenager and luckily, I’m still here to tell the story;)
* I can fall asleep to true crime stories
* I once ate non-stop for 10 hours (The reason my friends call me *Crocodile*)
