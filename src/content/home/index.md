## Hi, my name is Yuyang Zhou (Joey) 周宇洋.

In Chinese, the three characters mean **all-encompassing, cosmos, and ocean**.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)** in the Netherlands in July 2025. Starting 1 September 2025, I’ll join **ING** as a Tech Class Engineer. My graduation project, Large Model Inference on Edge Devices: Towards Efficient Deployment and Distributed Optimization, explored optimizing the deployment of video language models on resource-constrained devices.

Before that, I received my **Bachelor’s degree** from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**. During my studies, I worked on internships involving backend development, AI model optimization, and data driven product design. This work took place in organizations such as State Grid of China, Xiaomi Commercial, Kuaishou, and Signify, giving me both technical depth and cross-industry perspective.

Outside of work, I enjoy **photography** (Phone & Canon EOS M50), playing **Hearthstone** (Druid player), and creating **ASMR content** (Especially rapid tapping and eating sounds).
