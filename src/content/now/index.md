## Studying to graduate and find a job
I expect to gratuate from TU/e at July 2025. Before that I'll improve my professional skills as a full stack engineer and then find a job in the Netherlands. Here're the things I'm mainly working on:

### Courses
I still have 2 courses to finish this semester. They involves following skills: **distributed system design and implement**, **language virtual machine**, **Java**, **Python**...

### Graduation project
(tbc)

### Leetcode
I go over the algorithms and join the daily problem. I participate the biweekly contest as more as I can.

### Java development

## Getting fit
I started to go back to gym since the beginning of August. I would like to spend more time on workout but studying and working are really time consuming. I go to the gym four times a week for anaerobic exercise and swim for 40 minutes once a week. Due to a gluteal injury, I have to give up squarting and deadlifting and can only train my legs using fixed machines. In swimming, I have consolidated the breaststroke I learned a year ago and will attempt to learn treading water and other swimming strokes. I also watch videos on kinesiology and nutrition, which not only improve my knowledge in these areas but also help me practice English.
