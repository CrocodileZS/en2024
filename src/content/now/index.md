## Studying to graduate and job hunting
I expect to gratuate from TU/e at August 2025. Before that I'll improve my professional skills as a full stack engineer and then find a job. Here're the things I'm mainly working on:

### Courses
I still have 2 courses to finish.

### Graduation project
I will do my master's thesis in Signify. The topic is about edge computing.

### Preparation for interviews
