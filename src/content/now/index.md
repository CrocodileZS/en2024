This page shows what I'm focussing on at this point of my life. Think of it as a more relevant "About" page. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Graduation project
I'm doing my master's thesis in Signify. The topic is about visual-language model inference on edge devices.

## Job hunting
I expect to gratuate from TU/e at July 2025. Before that I'll improve my professional skills as a full stack engineer to get a job. I'm doing preparation for oa and interviews.

**Now I continue to write blogs because I want to write down what's going on about job hunting.**
