**TL;DR**: Enabled efficient on-device **video captioning** by applying **quantization and partitioning** to lightweight vision-language models, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy.

<details>
<summary> Details </summary>
Large scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) application in video captioning is inhibited due to their high computational and memory footprint. This project investigates methods for enabling efficient on-device inference by leveraging model quantization and segmentation strategies. The work initiates with an evaluation of various lightweight VLMs to shortlist potential candidates based on their availability as open-sources, replicable results, and model sizes. Both post-training quantization and quantization-aware training techniques are considered to shrink model sizes while maintaining captioning effectiveness. Additional partitioning schemes such as encoder-decoder separation and sliding window inference are proposed to partition the inference load among edge devices. Experiment results conducted with MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets verify their effectiveness with considerable savings in memory consumption while incurring minimal sacrifices in terms of effectiveness. The work concludes with considerations for pragmatic deployment together with an outline of directions for futures in hybrid edge-cloud architecture for captioning.

**TL;DR**: CogKTR is an open-source toolkit for **knowledge-enhanced text representation** in NLU, unifying acquisition, representation, injection, and application of external knowledge under the Unified Knowledge-Enhanced Paradigm (UniKEP). The toolkit is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/CogNLP/CogKTR), with an online demo and an instruction video.

<details>
<summary> Details </summary>
Modern NLP starts with text representation, converting discrete texts into continuous embeddings.
While pre-trained language models (PLMs) excel at this and have advanced natural language understanding (NLU), they usually rely only on textual context—insufficient for knowledge-intensive tasks. Integrating external knowledge into PLMs can produce richer, more knowledgeable representations. However, existing knowledge-enhanced methods vary greatly, making them hard to reproduce, extend, or combine.

To address this, we introduce CogKTR, a knowledge-enhanced text representation toolkit based on our Unified Knowledge-Enhanced Paradigm (UniKEP).
It includes four stages:

- Knowledge acquisition
- Knowledge representation
- Knowledge injection
- Knowledge application

CogKTR offers:

- Easy-to-use knowledge acquisition interfaces
- Multi-source knowledge embeddings
- Multiple knowledge-enhanced models
- Support for diverse knowledge-intensive NLU tasks

**TL;DR:** Built a **static analysis pipeline** using Maracas, Gumtree, e-knife, and SDG to detect **Java breaking changes and patches**, improving accuracy and efficiency in software evolution.

<details>
<summary> Details </summary>
During the process of software evolution, the dynamic relationship between dependencies and dependants often leads to breaking changes that disrupt software functionality. This report explores a pipeline designed to detect and analyze these breaking changes using a combination of static analysis, code differencing, and code slicing tools. I integrate Maracas, Gumtree, e-knife, and SDG to generate a comprehensive database of broken use slices and their corresponding patches. My methodology offers a structured approach to identifying and understanding the impact of breaking changes on client code. It contributes to the efficiency and accuracy of patch generation in Java software ecosystems.
