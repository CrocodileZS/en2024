## OA (really easy one) 25 Jan
4 questions. 2 are leetcode style and 2 are multiple choices.

1. Coding question about math
Give coordinates of three points and asked you to calculate the areas of the triangle.

2. Multiple choice: graph
Choose the correct sequence of dfs.

3. Calculate the time complexity
Something like this:
```
i = 1
while i < n:
    i = i ** 2
    // a process cost O(sqrt(i)) complexity
```
The final answer is O(sqrt(n))

4. Coding question about list
Find sub-lists [a, b, c] from list, s.t. a < b and c < b. Return the sub-list with the minimum sum (a+b+c).
